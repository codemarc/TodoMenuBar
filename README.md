# TodoMenuBar App

Welcome to my **TodoMenuBar App**—a badass creation forged out of need, passion, and a little something called AI. This ain't your grandma's todo list; it's built to fit **my** unique workflow, crafted with care, and packed with the features **I** want. You know, sometimes life isn’t about just writing down tasks; it’s about making those tasks bow to your will.

## About This Project

> *"Sometimes I need to focus on the todos of the day. While there are many todo apps, this one is mine—custom, relentless, and fitting like a glove."*

This project was **born fast and furious**, from inception to deployment in less than two hours—no filler, all killer. Built with a cocktail of **Cody from Sourcegraph**, **Visual Studio Code**, and the raw power of **Apple’s Xcode and Swift**. This app is what happens when precision meets artistry and a little AI-driven magic adds fuel to the fire.

**Hashtags? Sure, why the hell not.**
